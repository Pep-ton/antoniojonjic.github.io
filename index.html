      <h2>Skills & Education</h2>
      <p>
        As a third-year Organic Chemistry student at Hogeschool Leiden, I have developed a strong foundation in both theory and practice. I’ve gained hands-on experience with advanced analytical tools like GC, GC-MS, HPLC, and 1H-NMR, which have allowed me to analyze chemical samples with precision. Additionally, I’ve worked on synthesizing organic compounds, applying reaction mechanisms, and purifying products, honing my problem-solving skills along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        My education has covered a wide range of topics, from organic and inorganic chemistry to analytical chemistry and chemical reaction engineering. These courses have equipped me with the knowledge to approach research critically and with a focus on sustainability. I’m excited to continue building on my technical expertise as I explore new research opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable future.

      <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <p>Outside of my studies, I engage in various hobbies that help me develop my creativity and problem-solving skills. Baking is a perfect combination of science and art for me. The precise measurements and understanding of chemical reactions in the oven are aspects I deeply enjoy, as they mirror the precision required in chemistry. Playing the guitar provides a creative outlet and helps me develop patience and perseverance. Additionally, I have a growing interest in cybersecurity, where I combine my passion for technology and security. These hobbies not only offer relaxation but also enhance my analytical and creative thinking.</p>
